          As a designer, I like to focus on projects in the travel and leisure
          industry. I work both as a product designer and a frontend developer.
          Take a look at my work here, or browse my side projects. Right now, I
          study Interface Design at the University of Applied Sciences in
          Potsdam and work as a freelancer.
