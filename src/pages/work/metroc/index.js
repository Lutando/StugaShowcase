        In Mid 2016 I was asked to develop their new website (designed by{' '}
        <a href="http://killnicole.github.io/">Victoria Leontieva</a>) and help
        them scale their online enrollment business. Required by the client was
        a swift transition from their old website, while using the same
        Wordpress-powered stack.
